<h1>Overview</h1>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Unix does not track file types like many operating systems (e.g., VMS and RMS files)
    </h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>All files, even directories, are just a stream of bytes </h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>This approach facilitates flexibility in the commands (allows commands to be used on
    files not file types) </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>allows some non meaningful commands (e.g. sort /bin/ed) <ul>
          <li>this seems to be asking to sort the line editor ed </li>
          <li>when sort does this the output is not meaningful but sort and most Unix commands donít
            preclude doing this </li>
          <li>user makes determination of what is meaningful and what isnít </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Many commands can operate on any file and there is no good reason for Unix to
    restrict their capabilities </h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Leaves specific reactions to specific commands to be based on the purpose determined
    by the creator or the command rather than the operating system </h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Instead of creating distinctions Unix tries to efface them whether in files or
    commands</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
