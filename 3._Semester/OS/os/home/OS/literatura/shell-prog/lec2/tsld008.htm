<h1>Files and their Inodes</h1>

<ul>
  <li><h2>A file has several components: name, contents, and administrative info (e.g.
    permissions and modification times) </h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Administrative information is stored in the inodes </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>inodes also contain contain essential system data: how long, where on disk stored, etc. </li>
      <li>three times in inode: time contents last modified, time file last used, time that inode
        itself was last changed (e.g. set permissions) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Directory actually only stores the starting inode number of files within it </h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Unix tracks files only by their inode numbers </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Unix knows nothing at the file system level about names </li>
      <li>user assigned names are in the directory associated with the inode that is that file as
        far as Unix is concerned. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
