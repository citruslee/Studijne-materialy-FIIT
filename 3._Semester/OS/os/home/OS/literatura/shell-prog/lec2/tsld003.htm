<ul>
  <li><h2>most systems require negotiation by program or user to create a particular file type
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>this approach makes files operating system dependent </li>
      <li>reduces flexibility and portability </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h2>However implementation limits often exist in programs dealing with text which often

    <ul>

      <li>in Unix possible for program (mostly in C) to also read and use the directory file </li>
